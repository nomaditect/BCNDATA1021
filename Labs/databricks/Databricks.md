# Lab | DataBricks 

after setting yourself up on the community edition you will complete some activities.  



## steps 


1) sign up for the [community edition](https://databricks.com/try-databricks)

2) complete the quickstart tutorial
+ create a cluster called 'Quickstart'
+ link the notebook to the cluster and run 
+ create the table diamonds, manipulate the data and visualise a summary (SQL query)
+ create a pandas dataframe with Python (magic command needed) and visualise, following the notebook through and reviewing the tables /visuals 
+ try exporting the data from either SQL or Python to csv locally 

3) from the home menu, import a new data source (csv file 'cars_EV.csv' ) from your local machine to **create a table with UI** and use your QuickStart cluster to preview the table. In specify table attributes, check the columns, and correct the data types as needed, set the first row as header. Then create the table.

4)  Create a new SQL notebook to run a simple sql select query against the data source cars_EV.csv you have imported

5) from Workspace, import a pre prepared notebook from this url https://databricks.com/notebooks/gallery/PandasToKoalasTutorial.html and follow the notebook steps, running each cell. 

6) optional - do the same for this notebook https://databricks.com/notebooks/gallery/SparkSQLAndUDFs.html to explore and understand streaming data - we can discuss in class 

7) optional - explore how to ingest image and audio files to the workspace  

8) optional - basket analysis  https://databricks.com/notebooks/gallery/MarketBasket.html
- we will talk through this briefly in class , the data is actually now held on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data
