# Lab | Tableau -Geospatial

Build the following view in tableau and publish to your tableau public account in order to submit the url via the Student Portal

## Challenge 

You want to produce a map of London, UK which show the percentage of household recycling rates over the years, per borough (average recyling rate). This involves using Tableau, joining a spatial file (the geolocations/shape files of the London boroughs/regions) to a csv file which contains the recycling rates from 2013/14 to 2019/20


Your data source will be [https://data.london.gov.uk/](https://data.london.gov.uk/) - this is the [spatial data](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/statistical-gis-boundary-files-london) you will need but we would like you to search the site to locate the quantitative data set you need for this challenge Hint: use a key word search

Review points:

+ following the advice in class, connect to the spatial file first 
+ add a filter which will allow the audience to pick a year or a range of years and see the average rate per borough, as a suitable colour, on the map
+ relate or join the two data sources using the appropriate field in both sources of data 
+ to confirm your join is working, your map should look like [this one published on tableau public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sianedavies#!/vizhome/Spatial-recyclingratesperboroughinlondon/spatialjoinexample) and the map should not have any missing boroughs (white gaps) visible inside London
+ use a gradient colour for recycling rates rather than colouring the boroughs themselves 
+ Ensure the view is presented tidily, with an appropriate title and map layers, so the view is not too busy but it is clear where the map is
+ Test your year filter to confirm that is behaving as expected

Recommended :  Do add any comments on the trend/insights you observed to your readme to accompany the lab you submit

+ bonus - you will find other spatial files in the classmaterials. Explore each folder/spatial source we did not manage to cover in class and add to your tableau workbook. Or search the london data store for other spatial files.
