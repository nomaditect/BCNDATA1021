## Welcome to your first concept challenge! 

### Guidance:

* The hardest element of this task will be understanding the requirement, coming up with a theoretical solution and creating something presentable, quickly, which covers most, if not all angles. 
* We invite you to join up with other students in small groups of between 1-4, or if you prefer you can work alone. 
* You will be given a limited amount of time during class hours today to discuss this as a group and formulate your response together. 
* You will nominate a spokesperson from your group to present what you have developed to your classmates and answer questions
* We would like ALL students to upload the link to the presentation materials to the student portal before the end of this week (hint: you might need to create a tidy Readme in one of your github repositories!) 
* To clarify, you do not have to actually build a database, just sketch one out - either on paper, or using an online tool - I suggest Lucidchart for this. 


### Scenario : 
* You are a data analyst at a company called Gettoknowaplace which offers personalised recommendations to newcomers in big cities, based on paid for research topics. 

* Your boss has given your team this requirement last minute and wants you to present back a proposal at your next meeting, on Friday!!!
* The concept design should be for a database schema (a conceptual entity relationship diagram) which would store the relevant data for your chosen topic - it is important that the design is both logical and easy to query as another team in your company will design the query layer between the customer web application and the database.  

* Your case study customer is in her 30s and has recently relocated to the city where you live. Each group will select one of the topics from the below list; each topic includes some sample questions (appropriate to a traditional relational database structure) and a 'fluffier', unstructured question (U:) which might require more imagination to resolve. 

#### Outcomes:

##### 1. a group presentation to class of no more than 5 minutes including presenting the following...
* a conceptual 'ERD' which illustrates the sources and tables, relationships (think about 1:M cardinality/relationships), names of fields/entities, defined primary and foreign keys - this should be a shareable as a pdf, png/jpeg, can be hand-drawn and captured by photograph/scanning or created with software such as Visio/LucidChart. 
* Think about how easy the diagram is for others to understand and be prepared to clarify any terminology and concepts during a Q&A. 
* Remember this is conceptual, so you do not need to confirm whether these data sources actually exist, but you may have some suggestions in mind.
* an illustrative description of the unstructured data sources/ types and processes you would seek to include in your model 
* plus any specific examples of how this [U: data] could enhance and link into your relational/structured data. 
* a verbal summary of the (collaborative) process, what you found difficult, easy or interesting and how well you feel you met the task
* any next steps you identified during the process or anything you would do differently next time 

##### 2.submit the diagram via the student portal (all students)


## TOPICS and example QUESTIONS -choose one topic per group, and aim to cover 70%+ of the requirement(questions) as this is It1

### Transportation

* 1. whats the average journey time between any two public transport (ubahn or metro) stations? 
* 2. which train/ tram or bus route has the most stops?
* 3. are there parts of the city with more public transport options than others?
* 4. U: which routes are the more pleasant/ recommended by passengers / go to scenic areas? 

### Restaurants

* 1. which parts of the city have the most restaurants per sq km?
* 2. where can a vegan burger restaurant be found, with an opening time filter... eg. customer wants to visit on thursday at 6pm?
* 3. how many specified cuisine (eg Vietnamese) restaurants are there in the city? 
* 4. U: which restaurants are the best for big groups/parties? 

### Entertainment 

* 1. where are the biggest theatres in the city?
* 2. how many cinemas are there? and what type are they? eg independent, chain, art-house
* 3. which art galleries are open on Sundays?
* 4. U: ignoring covid, is the danceclub scene here growing or contracting? what about live music? whats hot or not?
