**Anomalies in denormalisation**

- In yesterdays lesson, we talked about the reasons why normalization is important in a database design. One of the reasons we did not talk about was data anomalies. Here are a couple of resources that you can use to read more about data anomalies. Go through these links and then we will have a discussion in class tomorrow:

- https://github.com/ironhack-edu/data_3.02_activities - all activities are on multiple table joins. even if you dont have time to do them, try to identify the tables you would need
